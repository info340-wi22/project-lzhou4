            <p>
                When hanging out with friends, there comes a moment when all members of the group's stomach grumbles. We all have had the problem of picking a common ground for choosing a place to eat out. Chick-fil-A? Burger King? Olive Garden? A <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/time-spent-thinking-about-food-study/">study</a> found that on average, we spend about 40 minutes thinking about food. This can be very time consuming and mentally laborious process just to find a what or where to eat. All these times spent figuring out food interests should have been used to revert back to productivity or actually exploring these food interests

                This kind of problem exists because there is a gap in sharing information. Your friend might not know your dining habit because people usually keep their preferences in their hearts and compromise the choice of other people. That's why we need a platform that record our food preferences and be able to share with friends to better understand each other's eating habit and help decide on the restaurants to explore together.

                One existing web app that addresses food preferences problems is <a href="https://web.topdish.app/#/home">TopDish</a>. TopDish allows users to record their own ratings for restaurants and dishes.  It accumulates the average rating for each dish and sets a score for that dish. This web app also has a feature for Deals. With this feature, it can help users compromise their food choices. However, TopDish is only available for people living in the United Kingdom and does not allow users to rank their preferences.
